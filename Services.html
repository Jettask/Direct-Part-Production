									<H2>We are unlocking the full potential of Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) 3D printing technology</H2>
									
<p> With groundbreaking speed and robust material properties, Multi Jet Fusion (also known as MJF or HP 3D printing) will speed your project's time to market. We are now heavly investing in our new 3D Manufacturing Center. This is powered by 5 HP Jet Fusion 3D printers. We now have the capability to produce hundreds of thousands of production parts each week. With our upgraded capacity combined with MJF's incredible speed and material properties, we can now fulfill high volume production orders - faster than ever. </p>

<p>HP's 3D printing technology utilizes fusing and detailing agents over a powdered nylon 12 building area, with infrared lamps fusing an entire layer in a single pass. This highly efficient method can build functional, geometrically complex parts 80 micron layers at a time - with mechanical properties that rival injection molded parts.</p>

<p>With this modern production process, we are able to produce parts faster than ever!</p>
									
	<h3> 3 Day MJF Printing Available</h3>
									<p>DPP takes you from innovation to production with speed, quality, and competitive pricing. We produce thousands of high-quality prototype and production parts daily and ship right to your door within 3 days.</p>
									
									<h2>What is a voxel?</h2>

<h1>DMLS</h1>
									<h2> Direct Metal Laser Sintering</h2>
									<img src="images/pic 16.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" alt="" />
									<br>
									<h3>Production Capabilities for Metal 3D Printing</h3>
									<p>Looking for an additive manufacturing solution for production projects? With our metal 3D printing technology, you’re able to choose from several secondary processes like post-process machining, tapping, reaming, and heat treatments that produce end-use production parts. To ensure high-quality parts, we also offer powder analysis, material traceability, process validation, and inspection reporting, and our direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) 3D printing process is ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 certified. It’s industrial 3D printing designed around your project needs—whether prototyping or production.</p>
									<p>We design and manufacture additive manufacturing systems for manufacturing components in a variety of metals using a process called metal powder bed fusion (or laser melting). Our expertise in process development and our experience in using the technology in our own manufacturing operations enable us to provide turn-key and optimised additive manufacturing solutions for a broad range of applications in the industrial and healthcare sectors.</p>
<p> The ultimate in speed and precision for metal 3D printing, Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), also known as SLM (Selective Laser Melting), additively manufactures 99% dense metal prototypes and end-use parts. Producing fine featured parts with the strength and durability comparable to forged parts, the DMLS process is ideal for functional components requiring fast lead times and a design freedom that you do not get with traditional machining. </p> <p>

In this process, dual 400-watt lasers micro-weld alloy powders at 30 micron layers as a bi-directional recoater blade deposits the next layer of alloy powder. With the unique dual laser features, this technology builds robust, metal prototypes and end-use parts with remarkably accurate features.</p>
									
									<h3>What is AM?</h3>
									<p>Additive manufacturing (AM), also called 3D printing, creates a three-dimensional part from a digital file.</p><p>

Thin layers of material are used to create complex shapes which cannot be produced by 'traditional' techniques such as casting, forging and machining.</p><p>

AM provides new design possibilities, including opportunities to combine multiple components in production, minimise material use and reduce tooling costs.</p>

<h1>SLA</h1>
									<img src="images/sla 111.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" alt="" />
<p> Stereolithography (SLA) is the first commercialized 3D printing technology, invented by 3D Systems' Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer Chuck Hull in the 1980s. It uses an ultraviolet laser to precisely cure photopolymer cross-sections, transforming them from liquid to solid. Parts are built directly from CAD data, layer-by-layer into prototypes, investment casting patterns, tools, and end-use parts. </p> <p>

Once the SLA printing process is complete, SLA parts are cleaned in a solvent solution to remove any residual uncured resin from the part surface. Cleaned parts are then cured in a UV oven.</p>
									<h3>About Stereolithography (SLA)</h3>
									<p>SLA is all about precision and accuracy, so it is often used when form, fit, and assembly are critical. The tolerances on SLA parts are typically less than 0.05 mm, and SLA offers the smoothest surface finish of any additive manufacturing process. With the quality SLA can achieve, it is particularly useful for creating highly precise casting patterns (e.g., for injection molding, casting, and vacuum casting) as well as functional prototypes, presentation models, and form and fit testing. SLA technology is extremely versatile and can be used in any number of areas where precision is paramount.</p>
									<p>SLA also offers a speed advantage when you require a variety of functional prototypes or quick access to casting patterns. SLA’s winning combination of speed and precision make it an excellent choice for evaluating prototypes. The accuracy of SLA means your prints are faithful to the final design, allowing you to identify and correct design flaws, collisions, and potential mass-manufacturing hurdles before production begins. SLA provides comparable characteristics to parts normally machined from polypropylene or ABS for low- to mid-volume production, and doesn’t require slow, expensive retooling for customization or required tooling changes. SLA also allows for reduced material costs, as any unused resin remains in the vat, ready for future projects.</p> <p>Because SLA parts can require support structures, they often require post-processing, which opens opportunities for new part characteristics. SLA parts can be vapor honed, or bead or sand blasted, and can even be electroplated with metal, such as nickel. Electroplating makes SLA parts significantly stronger, and also makes parts electrically conductive and more dimensionally stable in moist environments.</p>
