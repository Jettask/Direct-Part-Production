<div id="DMLS"></div>
<h1>DMLS</h1>
									<img src="images/dmls1.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="" />
<p> The ultimate in speed and precision for metal 3D printing, Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), also known as SLM (Selective Laser Melting), additively manufactures 99% dense metal prototypes and end-use parts. Producing fine featured parts with the strength and durability comparable to forged parts, the DMLS process is ideal for functional components requiring fast lead times and a design freedom that you do not get with traditional machining. </p> <p>

In this process, dual 400-watt lasers micro-weld alloy powders at 30 micron layers as a bi-directional recoater blade deposits the next layer of alloy powder. With the unique dual laser features, this technology builds robust, metal prototypes and end-use parts with remarkably accurate features.</p>

<div id="SLA"></div>
<h1>SLA</h1>
									<img src="images/SLA 1.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" alt="" />
<p> The veteran of all additive technologies, Stereolithography is known as the original 3D printing process for producing rapid prototypes and show models since 1989. This process (commonly referred to as SLA) utilizes a UV laser that cures parts one layer at a time in a photo-reactive epoxy resin. Widely regarded as one of the most accurate of the additive technologies, the Stereolithography 3D printing process is a popular choice amongst engineers looking for fine detailed, small featured parts as well as extraordinarily large components. </p> <p>

With both large-format and high-resolution SLA equipment, we can build parts as fine as .002" layer thickness on our high resolution Viper equipment - virtually overnight from your CAD data. We also offer a broad variety of resins to suit your rapid prototyping needs.</p>
	<h3> BENEFITS </h3>
									<li>High resolution – parts at .002” - .006" layers</li>
									<li>Fine features from a precise spot beam UV laser</li>
									<li>Large, seamless parts that can be bonded together with UV light reactive resins</li>
									<li>Waterclear models (in our SOMOS 11122 XC Watershed resin)</li>
									
									<br>
									<h3> APPLICATIONS </h3>
									<li>Functional prototypes and end-use parts</li>
									<li>Medical prototypes</li>

<div id="Polyjet"></div>
<h1>Polyjet</h1>
									<img src="images/polyjet1.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" alt="" />
<p> Vibrant color options and one of the fastest of our technologies, the PolyJET process is an ideal choice for attractive, high precision models needed quickly. PolyJET 3D printing rapidly produces parts with astonishingly fine detail, smooth surfaces, and precision. The technology works with a vast array of materials, including rigid opaque in hundreds of vibrant colors, clear and tinted translucent shades, rubber-like flexible materials, and specialized photopolymers for 3D printing in the dental, medical and consumer product industries. </p> <p>

WSimilar to an inkjet printer, this process jets layers of liquid photopolymer that is instantly cured with UV lights attached to the print heads. This speedy process creates fine layers for high resolution parts (up to 16 microns) that are produced quickly, sometimes in the same day. PolyJET is also popular for its ability to print multiple materials, durometers, and colors in one print - as well as living hinges, overhangs, and complicated geometries without needing to be assembled.</p>

<div id="SLS"></div>
<h1>SLS</h1>
									<img src="images/SlS1.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" alt="" />
<p> Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), also known as plastic laser sintering, uses Nylon based powders to build robust plastic parts. True to powder bed 3D manufacturing processes, SLS builds parts one layer at a time with the thermal energy of a laser in the Z axis - without support structure. Additionally, due to its nylon base material, it produces more robust parts that are approved for use in many end use production aerospace applications. Furthermore, as an added benefit to the technology, materials with filler added to the nylon are available for producing even stronger parts. </p>
	<h3> BENEFITS </h3>
									<li>Ideal for functional parts and assemblies</li>
									<li>Variety of materials offered including fire retardant plastics to a UL 94 V0 standard</li>
