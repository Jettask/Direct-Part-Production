<p> Cars. Essential to much of the working population and their families all over the world. Whether they are used for “getting where you’re going” or “going in style”, there must be no compromise on safety and reliability.  But now, with the rapid evolution of the industry, increasing consumer demands, and the race for the first autonomous vehicle – cars are getting smarter, more connected, and taking safety features to an unprecedented level.</p> <p>Trends driving the car of the future are all enabled by more complex and intelligent electronics. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), human-machine interface (HMI), electrification, and increased vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) connectivity rely on advanced electronics and sensing components. Electronics that must be produced at the highest quality levels, and quite literally, cannot fail.</p> <p>Technologies that enable these trends are creating additional demand for those who can combine the rapid innovation and product introductions associated with consumer electronics with the rigorous engineering, testing manufacturing, and reliability demands of this industry. As a world-class automotive supplier, DPP’s global manufacturing, supply chain expertise, and industry partners help automotive customers quickly and strategically capitalize on technologies that enable autonomy like ADAS, HMI, connectivity, and electrification.</p>
	<h3> Working to AIAG quality standards at automotive grade manufacturing locations.</h3>
									<p>A 50+ year history of automotive electronic component design, manufacturing, and supply-chain management makes us a reliable and experienced partner for automotive manufacturers and suppliers worldwide. We deliver the highest-quality components and products, leveraging over 90 design and manufacturing sites in 23 countries. This global scale and reach also helps our automotive customers quickly and strategically bring their products to market.</p>

<h1>Capital Equipment</h1>
									<img src="images/pic20.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="" />
									<h2>Enabling Customer Innovation to Empower Tomorrow's Technology</h2>
									<h3>Creating Certainty in Unpredictable Environments</h3>
									<p>DPP has broad, long-standing relationships with Industry leaders in large form factor capital equipment servicing a range of markets including Semiconductor, Automated Test, Energy delivery and Infrastructure, as well as a number of equipment providers to device manufacturers across the value chain.</p>
									<h3>Simplifying Complexity. Accelerating Innovation.</h3>
<p> The race is on. The markets we serve are in the business of building smaller, faster, more powerful, electronic devices — the kind that drive the proliferation of technology into our everyday lives. The manufacturing equipment required to keep moving these technologies forward can be amazingly complex. Our partners rely on our leading cross section of capabilities to create value in designing and realizing products operating at the atomic level. The precision and tolerances required to support that demand that we build in repeatability and predictability at each step as our products are developed, manufactured, delivered, with defect prevention and elimination as our goal. We employ Lean Six Sigma tools and training in all of our facilities around the world led by Lean Black Belt certified operations teams. We give customers the ability to move at great speed, security and certainty even in the most complex and unpredictable environments, and to be the disruptors, not the disrupted, in their respective markets.  </p>
	
									<p>DPP serves the capital equipment sector with best-in-class manufacturing services. With over 50 years’ experience as a trusted innovation partner, we understand your business and apply our comprehensive portfolio of capabilities to accelerate your time-to-market and ensure your market leadership with: </p>

									<p>Capital equipment OEMs face a number of challenges. They’re competing for a larger share of a smaller pool. The trend towards consolidation simplifies managing a long tail of supply chains and improves buying power, but it also means fewer partners and more offensive/defensive business plays. The drive to 3D NAND is accelerating the adoption of Flash technologies, and 14nm microarchitectures are gaining substantial ground. These types of advances disrupt the industry and typically require massive investments to overcome technological challenges.</p>
