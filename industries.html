<p> Cars. Essential to much of the working population and their families all over the world. Whether they are used for “getting where you’re going” or “going in style”, there must be no compromise on safety and reliability.  But now, with the rapid evolution of the industry, increasing consumer demands, and the race for the first autonomous vehicle – cars are getting smarter, more connected, and taking safety features to an unprecedented level.</p> <p>Trends driving the car of the future are all enabled by more complex and intelligent electronics. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), human-machine interface (HMI), electrification, and increased vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) connectivity rely on advanced electronics and sensing components. Electronics that must be produced at the highest quality levels, and quite literally, cannot fail.</p> <p>Technologies that enable these trends are creating additional demand for those who can combine the rapid innovation and product introductions associated with consumer electronics with the rigorous engineering, testing manufacturing, and reliability demands of this industry. As a world-class automotive supplier, DPP’s global manufacturing, supply chain expertise, and industry partners help automotive customers quickly and strategically capitalize on technologies that enable autonomy like ADAS, HMI, connectivity, and electrification.</p>
	<h3> Working to AIAG quality standards at automotive grade manufacturing locations.</h3>
									<p>A 50+ year history of automotive electronic component design, manufacturing, and supply-chain management makes us a reliable and experienced partner for automotive manufacturers and suppliers worldwide. We deliver the highest-quality components and products, leveraging over 90 design and manufacturing sites in 23 countries.
