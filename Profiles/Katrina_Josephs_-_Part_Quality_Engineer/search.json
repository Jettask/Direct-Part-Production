["Katrina Josephs . 1st Part Quality Engineer at Direct Part Production Direct Part Production University of Illinois Urbana Lyons, Illinois, United states . Contact info 500+ connections Message More About I am analytical, tactical and technically-minded professional with in manufacturing engineering, project management, product development, documenting, parts measuring and quality control. I also provide detailed reporting on quality control issues. I set up the metrology for parts and a strong believer in Quality by Design (QbD) that: • quality should be designed and built into a product • more testing doesn’t necessarily increase the quality of the product. It can often have the opposite effect • most quality crises and problems relate to the way in which a product was designed in the first place Love reading biographies and learning from other experiences, and get through at least 2 audiobooks a week, listening mostly while out with my dog or at the gym.
