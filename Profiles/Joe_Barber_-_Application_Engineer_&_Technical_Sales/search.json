["Joe Barber . 3rd Application Engineer & Technical Sales at Direct Part Production Direct Part Production University of Denver Denver, Colorado, United states . Contact info 600+ connections Message More About You could say I act as the bridge between our clients and the engineer's R&D centres. I am responsible for generating new business opportunities for Direct Part Production through application development. I like to say my job is, “To make sure that the design is optimized for the process, and make sure the process is then optimized for the design.” I love to educate customers on the benefits of new technology such as HP Multi Jet Fusion, and then help them choose the correct parts they need. I take customer input and sales information to design or redesign, develop, test, and implement complex problems and applications then optimize the design and process for cost and quality. I provide technical support and expertise to customers by testing applications and responding to feedback. I respond to customer issues, solves issues, perform customer sales/presentations. Due to my enduring passion for engineering, I enjoy building upon my knowledge of various computer programs that I can utilise to further my career in the industry. I also enjoy playing several sports, including tennis and indoor hockey. Featured Link Our New HP MJF Always one step ahead we provide the best for our customer so what new for you?
