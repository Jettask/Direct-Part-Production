["Joe Barber . 3rd Application Engineer & Technical Sales at Direct Part Production Direct Part Production University of Denver Denver, Colorado, United states . Contact info 600+ connections Message More About You could say I act as the bridge between our clients and the engineer's R&D centres. I am responsible for generating new business opportunities for Direct Part Production through application development. I like to say my job is, “To make sure that the design is optimized for the process, and make sure the process is then optimized for the design.” I love to educate customers on the benefits of new technology such as HP Multi Jet Fusion, and then help them choose the correct parts they need. I take customer input and sales information to design or redesign, develop, test, and implement complex problems and applications then optimize the design and process for cost and quality. I provide technical support and expertise to customers by testing applications and responding to feedback. I respond to customer issues, solves issues, perform customer sales/presentations. Due to my enduring passion for engineering, I enjoy building upon my knowledge of various computer programs that I can utilise to further my career in the industry. I also enjoy playing several sports, including tennis and indoor hockey. Featured Link Why MJF?
